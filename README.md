# RKO - Random-key optimizer 

This is an implementation of the RKO to solve combinatorial optimization problems.

This algorithm's C++ code has been designed to be easy to reuse. Users can only implement specific functions (read and decoder). 

Here, we have the RKO version 1.0 code.


## References

When using this algorithm in academic studies, please refer to the following works:

## Scope

This code has been designed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). To solve other problems, users only need to configure the Problem.cpp file.


## Running the algorithm

* Enter the Program directory: `cd Program`
* Run the make command: `make rebuild`
* Run the RKO: `./runTest ../Instances/testScenario.csv K T D`, where k is the number of metaheuristics used to solve the problem, T is the tuning method (0 is offline and 1 is online), and D is the debug mode (1 to print information in the screen and 0 to save information in file)

* Available metaheuristics:
"BRKGA"      = 0,
"SA"         = 1,
"GRASP"      = 2,
"ILS"        = 3,
"VNS"        = 4,
"PSO"        = 5,
"GA"         = 6,
"LNS"        = 7,
"BRKGA_CS"   = 8,
"RKO"        = 9,
"MultiStart" = 10.

* Or compile via terminal: `g++ -std=c++20 -o runTest main.cpp -O3 -fopenmp`


## Code structure

The code structure is documented in [1] and organized in the following manner:

* **SPECIFIC_CODE:**
    * **Problem.cpp**: Contains data structure of the problem, the input function, and the decoder.

* **GENERAL_CODE:**
    * **MH.cpp**: Contains all of the metaheuristic (MH) algorithm's mechanisms.
    * **Main.cpp**: Contains the main function to start the algorithm and stores the global variables.
    * **Data.h**: Represents the data structures.
    * **Output.h**: Stores the output functions, including the best solution found and statistical analysis of the MH.

## File testScenario.csv is the input data problem, and each line consists of:

- Instance Name
- Maximum runtime (in seconds)
- Maximum number of runs

Users need to create a folder named "Instances/ProblemName", where the instances must be; users also need to create a folder named "Results", where the results files are written.
